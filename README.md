### 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

I'm a **Systems Engineering student** at UNAB and a passionate **Frontend Developer** with a unique vision for design. My journey started with Arduino and electronics, but I found my true home in code.

I don't just write code; I **architect solutions**. I believe in building with a long-term vision, blending technical robustness with artistic expression. My style oscillates between **clean, minimalist modernism** (rounded-4xl, big borders) and **experimental, colorful creativity**.

> *My creativity comes from mixing everything I love: music, art, nostalgia, modernity, and deep curiosity.*

### 🌟 Projects that Define Me

- **[ChefSync](https://chefsync.co)** (In Development): My pride and joy. A SaaS POS for restaurants that taught me advanced architecture and patience.
- **[jpalomino.dev](https://jpalomino.dev)**: My dual-personality portfolio. A space where my "Professional" and "Creative" sides coexist.
- **Creative Experiments**: I love building landing pages with visual effects (Three.js, MagicUI) that leave a lasting impression.

### 🎨 Beyond Code

I'm not just a developer. My work is heavily influenced by:
- **Music**: I explored over **425 genres** this year. *DATA* by Tainy is a major design influence for me.
- **Art**: I draw and paint, which naturally reflects in how I build UIs.
- **Anime & 80s Futurism**: A huge source of aesthetic inspiration.
